## Scalping

More specifically, collectable scalping. I'm not a collector and do not emotionally resonate to fans of popular shows who have their _highly sought after collectables_ scalped of shelves and marked up by 500% on the resell-market. Collectable scalping is bad because people shouldn't be paying that much for a trading card/plastic figure in the first place.

It is a shameful income.
